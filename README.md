## Search for relevant projects and join the community

Search for relevant projects on Github based on your skil1s. You can use Github Explore for this purpose or sign-up for Code Triage to get an email on a different issue every day.

While choosing a project to start on, look for a project that is actively maintained (loads of commits) and has a lot of issues. Once you have found your relevant projects, Star & Fork the project, subscribe to its mailing list and slack channel. This is the best way to get help if you are stuck in setting up the project or making your first contribution.

## - Introduction about Git Workflows
A Git Workflow is the best way to work with git locally and on cloud without messing up the branches or creating merge conflicts.

## A Git Workflow I follow :

- git fetch --all --prune
- git co master
- git reset --hard upstream/master
- git push origin master/specified branch

## Thank You
